# GUI-for-Hotel
This is my first GUI project using python tkinter which display menu of hotel, takes order from customer and generates bill. Menu is present in text files in 'Menu' folder and bills will be saved in text format in 'Bill Records' folder.


GUI is created using Python Tkinter.
Menu is taken from 'Munu' folder.
User enters customer details and selects item from menu.
User can generate bill after selecting at least 1 item.
Bill will be displayed in new window to user and will be saved in 'Bill Records' folder.
